    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 289931230765056
    m_Localized: Greedy to the point of horror - all the best should have been his!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 289948381274112
    m_Localized: He bought a castle and began to build it higher and higher.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 289962742571008
    m_Localized: So that there would be enough space for all his treasures... And,
      of course, so that he could live in the tallest tower in the world!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290231219970048
    m_Localized: Yes, he was a terrible person, he did bad things...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290239625355264
    m_Localized: But so cool!

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290242787860480
    m_Localized: I heard that this bandit was the greediest of all.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290330683695104
    m_Localized: He took gold and jewelry from people, but it was still not enough
      for him.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290332940230656
    m_Localized: And then he decided to steal the dawn itself.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290459247501312
    m_Localized: His tower grew so high that it reached the very clouds.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290482702049280
    m_Localized: He climbed up, caught the first ray of sunlight - and locked it
      in a black chest.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290575450693632
    m_Localized: Since then the world has been plunged into darkness...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290642119155712
    m_Localized: People no longer saw the sun, and the bandit laughed in his tower,
      admiring the stolen light.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290727439687680
    m_Localized: But one day a girl came to his gate with a tattered leash in her
      hand. My cat is missing - she said.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290768963297280
    m_Localized: You took so much from people... Maybe her too?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290949066711040
    m_Localized: The bandit became curious and ordered to find the cat. Soon it was
      caught.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 290998798573568
    m_Localized: 'But when the girl was happy, he suddenly laughed: - No. Now she
      is mine!'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291071196454912
    m_Localized: "And he slammed the gates. The girl did not leave. She sat by the
      fortress and waited. A day, two, a week\u2026"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291095808630784
    m_Localized: And the bandit kept the cat in the tower, confident that now the
      girl would not go anywhere.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291220438179840
    m_Localized: But the cat was not going to put up with captivity.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291295293923328
    m_Localized: She scratched the walls, climbed everywhere - and in the end she
      found that very chest with the stolen dawn.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291348171513856
    m_Localized: I opened it - and suddenly a blinding light poured out!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291389032423424
    m_Localized: "The cat swallowed the dawn and\u2026 BAM!"
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291415930494976
    m_Localized: Turned into a huge fire tiger!!!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291438827200512
    m_Localized: The tiger picked up the girl, who had been waiting at the gate all
      this time, soared into the sky - and together they became a new dawn.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291519752101888
    m_Localized: And the next day the sun rose as if it had never been stolen.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291631052152832
    m_Localized: You know, that bandit... ended badly.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291658617118720
    m_Localized: After the return of dawn, people gradually stopped being afraid
      of his tower.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291659774746624
    m_Localized: And he himself seemed to have deflated - even the treasures began
      to seem to him like just... well, shiny stones.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291661574103040
    m_Localized: And throughout his entire life he never found anyone who truly loved
      him...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291737746857984
    m_Localized: He still tried to command his remaining henchmen, but they quietly
      ran away.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291769703260160
    m_Localized: The fortress was emptying. The gates creaked, the stairs wobbled,
      and thick cobwebs were already woven in the corners.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 291795284320256
    m_Localized: And then... he just disappeared. No one saw him. Only a lonely tower
      remained...

      m_Items: []
