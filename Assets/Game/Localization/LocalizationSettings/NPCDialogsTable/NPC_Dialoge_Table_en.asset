    m_Localized: Ah... this building is all that remains of the great king's castle...
      Later, the tower passed from hand to hand - and each owner added something
      of his own, which only made it grow taller. They say that in his youth, the
      king was a dreamer. He wanted to survey his entire kingdom - every city, every
      village. So he ordered a tower to be built - as high as possible. But the years
      passed, the king grew old, and the construction progressed too slowly.

    m_Localized: Oho! Welcome, traveler! Another daredevil dreaming of climbing our
      famous tower? If you can get to at least the second building, you can already
      be called a hero. But trying to conquer the top on foot is pure madness. All
      the stairs have long since collapsed, and the floors are rotten... Well...
      I wish you luck and patience, boy.

    m_Localized: I remember one story... There was a door in the castle that no one
      opened. The king had been building the tower for so many years that he gradually
      forgot about everything in the world. A small key to that door always hung
      on his belt, but he himself no longer remembered what it was needed for. "Your
      Majesty, what is there, behind that door?" the page once dared to ask. The
      king frowned... and suddenly something flashed in his eyes. They opened the
      door - behind it was a dusty closet. On the floor - a wooden sword and a cardboard
      crown. And on the shelves - tattered books with fairy tales that his mother
      read to him... I was happy here... - the king whispered.

    m_Localized: The years passed. One day, climbing to the top, the king again noticed
      a crooked, carelessly laid stone in the wall. Again he had to redo it... Again
      he had to call the craftsmen... When would everything be ready? But, having
      climbed to the unfinished top, for the first time in many years he looked at
      his city. Children were frolicking below, merchants were bargaining in the
      square, life went on as usual... From then on he no longer went up to check
      the masonry... ... The tower, once his pride, now only reminded him of the
      years wasted.

    m_Localized: 'Ah, the king''s chambers... There stood an old clock there - a
      gift from his mother from the time when he was a young prince. The clock had
      long since stopped, but the king always put off repairing it: I''ll get to
      it when I finish building the tower. Years passed. One day, already gray and
      hunched over, he looked at it again and ordered it to be repaired. The master
      he called examined the mechanism and threw up his hands. Your Majesty, the
      gears are worn out, the spring has broken... Now it can''t be fixed. The king
      stared for a long time at the tarnished glass, behind which the hands were
      frozen forever. "It''s strange..." he whispered. "It seemed to me that I had
      an eternity ahead of me... And outside the window the wind rocked the top of
      the unfinished tower... . . .'

    m_Localized: Hi! Did you know that this building was built by a famous bandit?
      Greedy to the point of horror - only he had to have the best! He bought a castle
      and began to build it higher and higher. So that there would be enough space
      for all his treasures... And, of course, so that he could live in the highest
      tower in the world! Yes, he was a terrible person, did bad things... But he
      was very cool!

    m_Localized: I heard that this bandit was the greediest of all. He took gold
      and jewels from people, but it was still not enough for him. And then he decided
      to steal the dawn itself. His tower grew so high that it reached the very clouds.
      He climbed up, caught the first ray of sunlight, and locked it in a black chest.
      Since then, the world has been plunged into darkness... People no longer saw
      the sun, and the bandit laughed in his tower, admiring the stolen light.

    m_Localized: 'But one day a girl came to his gate with a tattered leash in her
      hand. "My cat is missing," she said. "You''ve taken so much from people...
      Maybe her too?" The bandit became curious and ordered the cat to be found.
      Soon she was caught. But when the girl was happy, he suddenly laughed: "No.
      Now she''s mine!" And he slammed the gate. The girl did not leave. She sat
      by the fortress and waited. A day, two, a week... And the bandit kept the cat
      in the tower, confident that now the girl would not go anywhere.'

    m_Localized: But the cat was not going to put up with captivity. She scratched
      the walls, climbed everywhere - and in the end she found the very chest with
      the stolen dawn. She opened it - and suddenly a blinding light gushed out!
      The cat swallowed the dawn and... BAM! She turned into a huge fiery tiger!!!
      The tiger picked up the girl, who had been waiting at the gate all this time,
      soared into the sky - and together they became a new dawn. And the next day
      the sun rose as if it had never been stolen.

    m_Localized: You know, that bandit... came to a bad end. After the dawn returned,
      people gradually stopped being afraid of his tower. And he himself seemed to
      have deflated - even treasures began to seem to him just... well, shiny stones.
      And in his entire life, he never found anyone who truly loved him... He still
      tried to command his remaining henchmen, but they quietly ran away. The fortress
      was emptying. The gates creaked, the stairs wobbled, and thick cobwebs were
      already woven in the corners. And then... he simply disappeared. No one saw
      how. Only a lonely tower remained... :(

      tower. The archives of the port city contain many records of the sailor who
      built it. Not for protection or glory - but simply because he could. Its height
      seemed insufficient to him. He returned from each voyage with new people: engineers,
      madmen, artists. Each added something - twisted staircases, rotating platforms,
      transparent domes! The only sad thing is what it turned into in the end...'

      been a reverse clock\u2026 One day, the captain brought an old clockmaker from
      a distant country, almost blind, but with golden hands. He examined the tower,
      nodded and asked to bring gears, springs and glass. A month later, a huge clock
      appeared on one of its platforms - but not a simple one, but a reverse one.
      Its hands went against the flow of time, and instead of striking, you could
      hear the whisper of the surf\u2026 I went up to take a look\u2026 Now there
      is just steel in that place. Smooth, seamless\u2026"

    m_Localized: On one of his voyages, the captain met a woman who claimed that
      she could grow a garden where there was no soil or sun. He brought her to the
      tower, and she brought with her only a handful of seeds and a bottle of muddy
      water. Six months later, scarlet flowers bloomed on the steel beams, which
      no one could identify. Their petals did not wither, and their roots grew through
      the metal, as if it were soft soil for them. The captain then ordered a glass
      dome to be built around the garden... Well, if you believe the records...

    m_Localized: I also read how he brought a man from a distant desert country who
      spoke an unknown language. He brought with him dozens of mirrors - large and
      small. The mirror maker silently climbed the tower and began to build them
      into the steel walls at strange angles. A month later, those who climbed the
      stairs began to notice something strange... Some mirrors reflected non-existent
      lands, others - seas that were not on the maps. These were places where no
      man had ever set foot - the captain said... ...this is nonsense of course...
      But how poetic!

      creations, other people''s dreams. The captain no longer remembered where his
      ended and theirs began. The stairs led to rooms he had not built and did not
      know... ... The last records about the captain say one thing: he ordered to
      fill everything with steel. To the very top. There was nothing beautiful or
      amazing left. Only an ideal, dead surface... Too bad...'
