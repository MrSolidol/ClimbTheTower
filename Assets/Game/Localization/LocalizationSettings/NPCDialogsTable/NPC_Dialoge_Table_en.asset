      the tower passed from hand to hand - and each owner added something of his
      own, which only made it grow taller./w2.3/clerThey say that in his youth, the
      king was a dreamer. He wanted to survey his entire kingdom - every city, every
      village./w2.3/clerSo he ordered a tower to be built - as high as possible./w2.3/clerBut
      the years went by, the king grew old, and the construction progressed too slowly.

      the masonry.../w2.3/clerThe tower, once his pride, now only reminded him of
